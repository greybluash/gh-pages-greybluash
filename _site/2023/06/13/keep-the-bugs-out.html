    <p>As the temperature rises and the sun shines brighter, summer brings with it a delightful array of activities and outdoor adventures. However, along with the joys of summer come the inevitable presence of bugs. From buzzing mosquitoes to pesky flies, these unwelcome visitors can quickly turn a relaxing evening on the porch into an annoying ordeal. But fear not! In this blog post, we will explore a simple yet effective solution to keep bugs at bay during the summer months: using a fan. Let’s dive in and discover how embracing the breeze can be your secret weapon against these winged intruders.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How Bugs Are Deterred by Fans</li>
</ol>

<p>Believe it or not, bugs are not particularly fond of strong air currents. When it comes to flying insects, such as mosquitoes and flies, their light bodies make them susceptible to even gentle winds. By strategically placing a fan or two, you create a barrier of airflow that disrupts their flight patterns and makes it difficult for them to navigate effectively. Furthermore, the constant airflow generated by the fan also disperses the carbon dioxide and body heat we emit, which are two primary attractants for bugs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the Right Fan</li>
</ol>

<p>When selecting a fan for bug control, consider the following factors:</p>

<p>a. Size and Power: Opt for a fan with sufficient size and power to create a steady breeze across your desired area. A larger fan with adjustable speed settings allows you to customize the airflow according to your needs.</p>

<p>b. Oscillation Feature: Fans with an oscillation feature are ideal, as they can cover a broader area and distribute airflow more evenly. This helps ensure bugs are deterred from all corners of your outdoor space.</p>

<p>c. Outdoor Durability: Ensure that the fan you choose is designed for outdoor use, with weather-resistant construction and materials. This will ensure its longevity and performance even in humid or rainy conditions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Placement Matters</li>
</ol>

<p>Strategic placement of the fan is crucial for optimal bug deterrence. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>

<p>a. Entry Points: Position the fan near entry points such as doors, windows, or outdoor dining areas to create a barrier that prevents bugs from entering. Point the fan outward to blow bugs away from your space.</p>

<p>b. Seating Areas: If you have a patio or seating area, place the fan close to where people gather. This will not only create a pleasant breeze but also help keep bugs at a distance.</p>

<p>c. Consider Multiple Fans: Depending on the size of your outdoor space, consider using multiple fans strategically placed to cover different areas effectively. This ensures comprehensive bug control across the entire area.</p>

<p>We decided to solve this problem by strategically placing a fan by our patio door and use home automation toggle on and off when the door opens and closes.</p>

<p>What we used to achieve this:</p>

  <li>Some type of smart door sensor (we leveraged our existing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8B5A2A32-E2E6-4FAC-B34E-26D2762AAF43/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;store_ref=SB_A00396583DFFFNJRGMA6V&amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;aaxitk=87f79204579d5a083679b4bbeb2a034d&amp;hsa_cr_id=0&amp;lp_asins=B0BYTJNKZ5%252CB0BYTL3WFM&amp;lp_query=abode%2520security&amp;lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_lsi4d_cta&amp;pd_rd_w=KQqQt&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.cd95889f-432f-43a7-8ec8-833616493f4a%253Aamzn1.sym.cd95889f-432f-43a7-8ec8-833616493f4a&amp;pf_rd_p=cd95889f-432f-43a7-8ec8-833616493f4a&amp;pf_rd_r=M8J7EVVMGRRYM7CZP3M4&amp;pd_rd_wg=CJRVP&amp;pd_rd_r=3703fb3a-ac73-4a49-865f-b44a2dd5234e&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=greybluash-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=a81ca6fc38f088438e3c5dd273774b27&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Abode Security System</a> door sensor)</li>
  <li>Home Assistant automation</li>
</ol>

<p>Once we have strategically placed the fan by the patio door we positioned the BroadLink across from it in a concealed manner to transmit signals to toggle the fan on and off.</p>

<p>If this is your first time setting up BroadLink, you will need to learn the commands from the remote that came with the fan to be able to control it through Home Assistant. Here is a link to their <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2023-06-16</strong> Update: Using the BroadLink to transmit IR signals to toggle on and off the tower fan did not work consistently. Largely due to the positioning of the BroadLink and the the communications require line of sight. Meaning if someone happened to be standing in front of the fan at the point the patio door was open, the fan would not receive the command.</p>

<p>Due to the limitations of IR, I decided to use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B7NXV4R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=greybluash-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=09e5aeb7c2dd1aaa81e51c1d094eff6f&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Switchbot</a> smart button pusher instead. This solution turned out to be way more reliable.</p>

<p>Once you have learned the commands, now it is time to program the automation, below is an example of mine that I used.</p>

<p>And that is it!</p>

<p>This summer, don’t let pesky bugs dampen your outdoor enjoyment. Harness the power of airflow and keep them at bay with the help of a fan. By strategically positioning fans, you create a protective barrier that disrupts their flight patterns</p>
