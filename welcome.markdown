- Enter through the gate on the LEFT as you are facing the house
- You can leave the door propped open for your guests

# Pool Etiquette & Safety

- No food or drink in or around the edge of the pool
- No foreign objects in the pool, only pool toys and floaties
    - This is very important as the filter can get clogged by foreign objects 
    If there is a violation of these rules, we will need to charge an additional $100 for cleaning and preparing the pool for the next event
- Children must be supervised at all times
- No jumping off the pool wall 
- Do not hold the pool cover while in the pool as it can break 

# Restroom
- There is a restroom available that is located inside our private residence
- We ask guests to only use the restroom if they are going indoors and not to the kitchen, living, or other areas inside. If you need to use the kitchen for any reason (e.g., fridge), please let us know beforehand. 
- Please keep shoes outside and please keep the sliding door closed after entering/exiting 

# Clean up and Garbage
- You are welcome to use the two outdoor trash and recycling bins
- If you have additional trash or recycling, please plan on removing them as part of your clean up
    - If you prefer to leave the additional trash and recycling, there will be an additional charge of $50 to dispose of your trash. Please notify the host prior to your event if you would like that added.

# Overtime and additional charges 
- If you need additional time either before or after your booking, please contact the host. Overtime charges will be 1.5x the hourly rate if you do not notify the host prior to going over. 

# Miscellaneous 
- There is a leaf blower next to the shed that you can use to blow away debris and leaves if you’d like
- Also, music is more than welcomed! We just ask that you keep it at a respectable volume

Any additional questions please reach out to the host: Jason at (408) 800-2455
