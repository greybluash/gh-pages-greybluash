A fireplace instantly adds warmth, comfort, and ambiance to any room. However, traditional wood-burning fireplaces can be costly and require regular maintenance. Thankfully, there's an alternative solution that allows you to enjoy the cozy atmosphere of a fireplace without the hassle: a DIY electric insert fireplace. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of electric fireplaces and provide a step-by-step guide to help you create your very own electric insert fireplace.

Benefits of Electric Insert Fireplaces:

1. Easy Installation: Electric insert fireplaces are incredibly simple to install compared to traditional fireplaces. You don't need to worry about venting or chimneys, making them suitable for both apartments and houses.
2. Cost-effective: Electric fireplaces are energy-efficient, allowing you to enjoy the warmth without significantly increasing your energy bill. They also eliminate the need for purchasing and storing firewood, saving you money in the long run.
3. Low Maintenance: Say goodbye to cleaning up ashes, soot, and chimney inspections. Electric insert fireplaces require minimal maintenance, with no need for regular cleanups or chimney sweeps.
4. Safe and Eco-friendly: Electric fireplaces eliminate the risks associated with open flames, such as accidental fires or harmful fumes. They also provide a greener option, as they don't release any pollutants or carbon emissions into the environment.

Creating Your DIY Electric Insert Fireplace: Before you start the installation process, here's a list of materials you'll need:

- Electric fireplace insert: Choose a model that fits your desired size and style. Ensure it comes with a remote control and adjustable heat settings. We decided on this model that fit our current traditional fireplace on Amazon.
- Fireplace surround: You can construct a custom mantel and surround using materials like wood, brick, or stone. However if you already have a traditional fireplace you can create an insert out of 2x4 that will hold the electric insert in place. 
- Tools: Measuring tape, screws, screwdriver, level, drill, and a jigsaw (if necessary).
- Electrical tools: Wire strippers, electrical tape, and wire connectors. (if necessary). 
- Safety equipment: Gloves, safety goggles, and a fire extinguisher.

Step-by-step Installation Guide:

1.  Measure and prepare: Measure the dimensions of your fireplace opening to ensure a proper fit. Clear the area and remove any debris or obstacles.

2. Assemble the surround: Construct your fireplace surround according to your preferred design. If using wood, measure and cut the pieces to size. Secure the surround to the wall using screws and a level to ensure it's straight.

3. Prepare the electrical connections: Locate an electrical outlet nearby or hire a licensed electrician to install one. Ensure the outlet is properly grounded and can handle the electrical load of the fireplace.

4. Install the electric insert: Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the electric fireplace insert within the opening of the surround. Use the provided mounting brackets or screws to secure it in place. We went the easy route since we had an outlet close by and purchased a flat extension cable that will split in through the side and go inside the fireplace behind the insert. 

5. Connect the wiring: Turn off the power supply to the area. Connect the fireplace's wiring to the electrical outlet using wire connectors, ensuring the connections are tight and secure. Use wire strippers to expose the necessary lengths of wire and cover the connections with electrical tape. Since we did not have to do any extra wiring but we were very interested in the power consumption we purchased a couple smart plugs that has power monitoring capability.

6. Test and finalize: Double-check all connections and ensure everything is securely fastened. Turn on the power supply and test the fireplace's functions, including the heat, flame, and lighting settings. Adjust the settings according to your preferences.
